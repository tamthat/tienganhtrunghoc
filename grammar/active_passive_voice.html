            <h3>⚠️ Những Lỗi Phổ Biến</h3>

            <p><strong>Lỗi 1:</strong> Quên thay đổi động từ thành Past Participle (V3)</p>
            <div class="example">
                ❌ A letter is write by her | ✅ A letter is written by her<br>
                ❌ The house was build by them | ✅ The house was built by them
            </div>

            <p><strong>Lỗi 2:</strong> Sai dạng của "be" theo thì</p>
            <div class="example">
                ❌ She will written a letter | ✅ She will be written a letter<br>
                ❌ The book are read by him | ✅ The book is read by him
            </div>

            <p><strong>Lỗi 3:</strong> Quên thêm "being" trong các thì Continuous</p>
            <div class="example">
                ❌ A letter is written by her (Present Continuous) | ✅ A letter is being written by her<br>
                ❌ The house was built by them (Past Continuous) | ✅ The house was being built by them
            </div>

            <p><strong>Lỗi 4:</strong> Dùng Passive cho câu không có tân ngữ</p>
            <div class="example">
                ❌ He sleeps (Intransitive - không có Passive)<br>
                ✅ He is sleeping (Continuous - có Passive: He is being slept - sai)<br>
                ✅ Chỉ dùng Passive với động từ ngoại động
            </div>

            <p><strong>Lỗi 5:</strong> Nhầm lẫn vị trí của "been" và "being"</p>
            <div class="example">
                ❌ A letter have being written | ✅ A letter have been written<br>
                ❌ The wall was being painted been by her | ✅ The wall was being painted by her
            </div>
        </div>

            <h3>✨ Mẹo Học Hiệu Quả</h3>

            <p><strong>Mẹo 1: Nhớ Công Thức Cơ Bản</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subject + be (conjugated) + Past Participle + (by + agent)</li>
                <li>Thay đổi động từ "be" theo thì, giữ nguyên Past Participle</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mẹo 2: 5 Bước Chuyển Đổi</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Xác định S, V, O</li>
                <li>Hoán đổi O và S</li>
                <li>Chuyển V thành V3</li>
                <li>Thêm "be" với dạng phù hợp theo thì</li>
                <li>Thêm "by + agent" (tuỳ chọn)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mẹo 3: Học Quy Tắc "Being" Cho Continuous</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present Continuous: is/am/are + being + V3</li>
                <li>Past Continuous: was/were + being + V3</li>
                <li>Future Continuous: will + be + being + V3</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mẹo 4: Perfect Tense - "Been" Không "Being"</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present Perfect: have/has + been + V3</li>
                <li>Past Perfect: had + been + V3</li>
                <li>Future Perfect: will + have + been + V3</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Mẹo 5: Thực Hành Với Một Câu</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lấy một câu chủ động đơn giản</li>
                <li>Chuyển thành bị động cho 12 thì</li>
                <li>So sánh kết quả với bảng tóm tắt</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>💡 Khi Nào Dùng Passive Voice?</h3>

            <p><strong>✅ Dùng Passive khi:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chủ ngữ của câu không quan trọng: The house was built 20 years ago</li>
                <li>Muốn nhấn mạnh hành động hoặc kết quả: She was awarded a prize</li>
                <li>Người thực hiện hành động không rõ: The letter was lost</li>
                <li>Viết báo cáo chính thức hoặc khoa học: The experiment was conducted carefully</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>❌ Tránh Passive khi:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chủ ngữ rõ ràng và quan trọng: She wrote the letter (tốt hơn "The letter was written by her")</li>
                <li>Muốn câu đơn giản, rõ ràng: Use active voice for clarity</li>
                <li>Động từ là nội động: He sleeps (KHÔNG có passive)</li>
            </ul>
